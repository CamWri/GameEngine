        TODO:

        Fix bug where if you fire and hit an enemy and dont fire another bullet, the enemy is still red and the hit detection 
            is inconsistant

        Implement a door player collision to send you to the next room
            Ask how circle-rectangle collisions happen or a way to do an alternative version of it

        Implement the new way of movement not being related to frames, look at example from class
        
        Might be able to use circle circle collision with an invisible circular wall around the chaser and if character is 
        colliding with invisible wall, it chases character for a period of time, if it is within a bigger radius, 
        it moves in you general direction, else, it moves randomly

        List of possible enemies
            Dweller
                Stays undergroup and pops up randonly, does some sort of attack, and then dives back down and 
                randomly picks a new spot
            Trapper
                Puts down mine like things and when hit deal massive damage
            Chaser(Complete)
                Psuedo randomly movement to chase the enemey
            Dasher(Complete)
                Waits until in los and dashes out to get the character, then retrets back to the wall, if not attacking,
                it moves up and down one side of the wall
