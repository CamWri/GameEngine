        TODO:

        Fix GetDoorCordinates, door colors are the same for each door, even though they shouldn't be and I don't know why

        Implement new architecture of EventSystem handiling, look at github for example

        Fix door and character collision so that the door is the entire length and not just the center

        Fix bug where if you fire and hit an enemy and dont fire another bullet, the enemy is still red and the hit detection 
            is inconsistant

        Implement the new way of movement not being related to frames, look at example from class

            Dweller
