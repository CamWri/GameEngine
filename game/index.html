        Questions:
            Explain my idea for a tank enemey, and how dyanamically draw something based off of time
                Alernative - I have 3/4 premade gameobjects that are called whenever the character gets to close
            
            How to stop something from being drawn and/or adjust the draw function to either make it bigger, smaller, 
                or dissapear for my dweller enemey concept

        TODO:
        List of possible enemies
            Dweller
                Stays undergroup and pops up randonly, does some sort of attack, and then dives back down and 
                randomly picks a new spot   
        
        Completed Enemies:
            Charger(Complete)

            Chaser(Complete)
                Psuedo randomly movement to chase the enemey
            Dasher(Complete)
                Waits until in is in LOS and dashes out to get the character, then retrets back to the wall, if not attacking,
                it moves against the wall   
            Acid Shooter(Complete)
                Poisoner leaves puddles of acid on the ground at the end of the shot
            
        Partial Completed Enemies:
            Tank(Partial, still need to do attack)
                Big, slow, close range character, hits the ground and causes a circle of damage
